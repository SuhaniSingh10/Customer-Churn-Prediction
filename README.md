# Customer-Churn-Prediction

## Description
This project aims to predict customer churn using machine learning techniques. By analyzing customer behavior and engagement metrics, the model helps businesses identify at-risk customers and implement strategies to retain them.


## Data
The dataset used in this project includes various features related to customer demographics and behavior, such as:
- CustomerID: Unique identifier for each customer.
- Gender: Gender of the customer (Male/Female).
- Age: Age of the customer.
- Tenure: Number of months the customer has been with the company.
- Service Usage: Metrics related to how often customers use services (e.g., number of calls made).
- Churn: A binary variable indicating whether a customer has churned (1) or not (0).
  
  The dataset may require preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.


## Model
This project employs various machine learning algorithms to predict churn, including:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forests
- Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM)
  
  The models are evaluated based on metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC to ensure robust performance.


## Results
The results section of the notebook provides insights into model performance. Key metrics include:
- Accuracy: The proportion of correctly predicted instances out of all instances.
- Precision: The ratio of true positive predictions to the total predicted positives.
- Recall: The ratio of true positives to the actual positives.
- F1 Score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall.
  
Visualizations such as confusion matrices and ROC curves are included to illustrate model effectiveness.
